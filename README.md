# CS753 - ASR Hacker & Poster Role for STEMM: Self-learning with **S**peech-**T**ext **M**anifold **M**ixup for Speech Translation

## Team Pitch Perfect

This project (STEMM) is an implementation of the ACL 2022 main conference paper [STEMM: Self-learning with Speech-text Manifold Mixup for Speech Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10426). 

The poster (MSN) has been added to the root folder. There is a python notebook that can be used to run this model. Since the dataset being used is very large, we will use a smaller dataset MaSS - Multilingual corpus of Sentence-aligned Spoken utterances (https://github.com/getalp/mass-dataset/tree/master), developed by the CMU team (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12895.pdf). 

There is google colab notebook containing the code to run this project. Instead of the montreal forced aligner, we have used a muas aligner. (https://www.bas.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasMAUS.html). 
Since the dataset (must-c) was extremely large and the code is heavily tailored for must-c dataset, we were not able to complete this.
